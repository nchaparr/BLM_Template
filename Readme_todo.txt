3) Fig 2 deltah_gamma:  I think we should change \delta h to just \delta so we keep the same symbol as garcia
   and keep it symmetric with \Delta.  We've got a problem in that \Delta \theta is ambiguous (as is \delta \theta)
   since each symbol separately has a definition, so you can't tell a jump from a product.  Still working on this. (NC) I disagree with this for now (NC)

6) Fig. 5 scaled_downwarm_theta:  text letters inside boxes (NC) I think we should remove this plot and instead refer to the thesis.(NC)  



Done
   
1) Fig 1.  height_defs  -- exchange b and c to put the new profile last, add text() letters to upper right corners
        xlabel for box a should be  both \theta_0, \bar{\theta}.  xlabel for box b should be \overline{theta} in
        numerator

2) Move temperature jump definitions to follow Fig. 1 and make sure they're unambiguous so Ri (3) is clear.

4) Fig 3 rss_fit_hight:  text leters inside figure. Don't we mean h, not h_0 (Fig. 1) in this discussion (NC) we mean h_0 i.e. mixed layer height (NC)

5) Fig. 4 ML_Height_hist_5: text letters inside figure

7) Fig. 6: theta_grad_profs: text letters inside boxes -- change axis labels for c) and d) per Douw's comment
       c) and d) y axes are different? (NC) the axes are the same, but heights are based on the unscaled (a) and scaled profiles (b)(NC)

8) Figs 7: scaledweinvri_delt_f_GM  -- text letters inside boxes  -- change axes  to swap \Delta for \delta
